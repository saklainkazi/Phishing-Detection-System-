Phishing-Detection-Extension
A browser extension that detects phishing websites using Machine Learning by analyzing multiple URL parameters and domain details. This open-source project aims to enhance user security by providing real-time warnings for suspicious links.

🚀 Features
Machine Learning-Based Detection – Analyzes 30+ URL parameters to detect phishing websites.
Real-Time Alerts – Notifies users immediately upon visiting a suspicious website.
Cross-Browser Support – Compatible with Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.
Open Source & Extensible – Easily add more phishing indicators or improve the ML model.
🛠 Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Browser Extension APIs)
Backend/Model: Python (Flask/FastAPI for ML integration)
Machine Learning: Random Forest / Decision Tree models

⚙️ Installation
1. Clone Repository
https://github.com/saklainkazi/Phishing-Detection-System.git
cd Phishing-Detection-Extension
2. Load Extension in Browser
Open chrome://extensions/

Enable Developer Mode

Click Load unpacked and select the extension/ folder

3. Run Backend (Optional if using API)
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
📊 How It Works
Extracts parameters from the current URL (length, subdomains, HTTPS status, etc.)

Evaluates them using a pre-trained ML model (stored locally or served via API).

Performs additional WHOIS checks for domain authenticity.

Shows result: Safe / Suspicious / Phishing in real time.
